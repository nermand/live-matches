## Instructions

In order to have fully working solution, there should be a web server running this application, with index.html as starting point. 
I have used Angular to complete this assignment, and in order to resolve CORS issues encountered when running app from file system (file://), app web server should host the app. 
Any web server will do, I used node's http-server, as a simplest, and quickest solution.

Again, due to CORS issues, I have used jsonp while communicating with an API, but as Angular uses $http service to load templates as well, running web server was needed after all.

All dependencies/ libs are hosted locally, and even API's response is contained in the data/evens.json file, to remove need for live connection, in case that is needed. To enable offline mode, a flag isOfflineMode in the index.constants.js file should be set to 'true'.

It wasn't asked as a requirement, so I didn't implement it, but what would be more appropriate and is considered as the best practice is to reference assets directly from CDN, or have bower to resolve all dependencies.

Lastly, even though there is no grunt/ gulp tasks implemented for minification and obfuscation, all code comes prepared for it and is already min-safe.
